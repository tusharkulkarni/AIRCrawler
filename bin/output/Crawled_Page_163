Pay the non-refundable deposit or total Camp fee online, if you choose. A spot cannot be held for your child until the non-refundable deposit is received. Download and print the Supplemental Camp Application Form(s) before leaving the site. Mail your completed and signed Supplemental Camp Application Forms via U.S. Postal Mail to the local American Diabetes Association office. Include a check or money order for the balance due with the Supplemental Camp Application Forms if you did not pay the full fee online. If you are seeking financial aid, do not send payment until notified by the local American Diabetes Association office. For technical support, contact your local American Diabetes Association. Step 2: Check your mail/email for a confirmation notice and information packet from your local American Diabetes Association. Once received, review the information carefully. Check for additional information needed from you, deadlines for payments and paperwork submission, check-in information, packing list, and other Camp details. If you do not receive a confirmation in two weeks, contact your local American Diabetes Association to check the status of your application. Acceptance is contingent upon review of all camper forms by the Camp Medical Team to ensure that we can accommodate your child's needs and provide a safe environment in which they can fully participate in the Camp program. Applications are processed in the order they are received. All fees must be paid in full 30 days before camp starts. No exceptions. Paper Application Step 1: Request a Paper Application. Print the Camp brochure. If the Camp you are interested in does not have a Brochure, contact your local American Diabetes Association and request a paper application. Complete the Reservation Form in the Camp brochure. Write a check for the non-refundable deposit or contact your local American Diabetes Association office if you choose to make a credit card payment. Mail the Reservation Form and non-refundable deposit to your local American Diabetes Association. This reserves a space for your child but does not complete the application process for Camp. Step 2: Complete the Camp application and forms. After the American Diabetes Association receives your reservation form and deposit, a paper application packet will be mailed to you. Fill out the Camp application and forms. Don't delay in sending back forms—many Camps fill up quickly. Return these forms via U.S. Postal Mail to your local American Diabetes Association with payment for the camp fee. If you are seeking financial aid, do not send camp fee payment until notified by the local American Diabetes Association office. All camp fees must be paid in full 30 days before camp starts. No exceptions. Step 3: Check your mail for a confirmation notice and information packet from your local American Diabetes Association. Once received, review the information carefully. Check for additional information needed from you, deadlines for payments and paperwork submission, check-in information, packing list, and other Camp details. If you do not receive a confirmation in two weeks, contact your local American Diabetes Association to check the status of your application. Acceptance is contingent upon review of all camper forms by the Camp Medical Team to ensure that we can accommodate your child's needs and provide a safe environment in which they can fully participate in the camp program. Applications are processed in the order they are received. Camp Refunds Complete refund information will be provided when you apply for Camp.
