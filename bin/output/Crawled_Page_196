More than one-third of our research portfolio is dedicated to projects relevant to type 1 diabetes. Read about the highlights of some of our notable research studies. Regenerating Human Beta Cells Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes result from a complete or partial loss of beta cell number and function. Dr. Fiaschi-Taesch is investigating the mechanisms through which human beta cells proliferate. Targeting the Autoimmune Response to Prevent Type 1 Diabetes Dr. Piganelli is looking for ways to prevent type 1 diabetes by interrupting the autoimmune process. Identifying Type 1 Diabetes before Beta Cell Loss Dr. Hessner is investigating so-called “biomarkers,” which are components in blood or tissue samples that can be measured to predict which individuals are most likely to develop type 1 diabetes. Explore: Type 1 Research Highlights A Message from Jane Chiang, MD Type 1 diabetes: It frustrates. It frightens. It hurts.

Addressing Obstacles to Islet Transplantation Islet transplantation has long offered hope as a curative measure for type 1 diabetes. However, long-term immunosuppressive therapy is required to avoid rejection of the transplanted islets. Developing New Technology for Continuous Glucose Monitoring Dr. Zhou has led the development and testing of materials called hybrid nanogels to serve as probes that can accurately sense glucose concentrations. Preventing and Treating Hypoglycemia through Automated Glucagon Delivery Dr. Russell’s research has shown that low doses of glucagon delivered automatically by a system that uses continuous glucose monitoring, similar to closed-loop insulin systems, are effective at preventing hypoglycemia. Improving Technology to Save Eyesight Dr. Jayagopal is leading a study to develop targeted therapy for retinopathy that would recognize and deliver therapy only to diseased tissue. Providing Internet-Based Behavioral Care for Teens with Diabetes Dr. Grey reports the use of two internet-based programs, focused alternately on diabetes education or coping skills, improved quality of life for teens with type 1 diabetes equivalently.
