Read stories about some who have received help through the American Diabetes Association's Legal Advocacy Program. Kevin's Story Kevin, a seventh grade student from Encinitas, California, has type 1 diabetes. Kevin needed a 504 Plan established to ensure that he received the accommodations he needed at school and equal access to school-related activities. The school administration denied the 504 Plan because they said Kevin's grades were "too good." His mother, Sandy, contacted the American Diabetes Association for help. After confirming that Kevin had a legal right to a 504 Plan, and collaborating with others, Sandy was able to work with the school to have a 504 Plan set up that will cover Kevin through high school.
