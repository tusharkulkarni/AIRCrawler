Others have faced - and defeated - discrimination because of diabetes. Here are some recent examples. Kevin's Story Download a print-ready PDF of this story. Coffee, Snacks and Some Help from Legal Advocacy Sandy of Encinitas, California, needed some help on behalf of her son Kevin, a seventh grader. Kevin, who has type 1 diabetes, had a 504 Plan in elementary school, but it didn't carry over to his new school. He needed a new 504 Plan to ensure that he would be treated fairly, stay medically safe and have the same access to education as his peers in middle school. In October 2015, Sandy met with the counselor and a few of Kevin's teachers at the school. They denied Kevin a 504 Plan because his grades were "too good" and said that a 504 Plan was only needed for students with learning problems. Instead, they set up an individualized health plan (IHP) for Kevin. But Sandy knew that an IHP would not fully protect him. Why did it matter which plan was set up for Kevin? An IHP is an agreement that outlines medical care for students with special health care needs.But a 504 Plan includes extra protections for people with disabilities. Diabetes is considered a disability under federal law. 504 Plans also ensure that students with disabilities receive the accommodations that they need at school, as well as equal access to school-related activities like field trips and extracurriculars. Sandy contacted the American Diabetes Association for help. One of the Association's Legal Advocates confirmed that Kevin was protected under federal law. He gave Sandy resources to help, including a sample letter that outlined the rights of students with diabetes. Sandy felt that the school's administrators did not fully understand laws that protect students with diabetes. She used the sample letter, added information about Kevin and sent it to the school principal. If the letter didn't work, Sandy was prepared to file a complaint with the school district's superintendent. But the school agreed to meet with her again. Sandy took some helpful suggestions from the Association's legal advocate in preparing for this meeting. Kevin would be attending this school for two years and then move on to high school within the same district, so she wanted to establish a good relationship with the administrators. To encourage friendly and constructive conversation, Sandy brought coffee and snacks. To help her feel confident, she also took along another parent who had more experience with the issue and understood the laws about school and diabetes. The result? A 504 Plan was set up for Kevin that will cover him through high school. Sandy is glad that she fought for Kevin&'s rights and knows that her efforts will also help other students with diabetes down the road. "A lot of people were helped. Thanks to the American Diabetes Association, the resources they provided and the other parents who encouraged me. The help from the Association's legal advocacy program was vital, and having that help at no charge was amazing. As a side note, we just sent a small donation to the Association as a thank you." Kamdyn Wilds' Story Download a print-ready PDF of this story. Eight-year-old Kamdyn, who has type 1 diabetes, was enrolled in an after-school Boys & Girls Club program in Gloucester, Virginia. Before Kamdyn started, her mom, Chelesa, contacted the program's director to talk about Kamdyn's diabetes care needs. The director, who has type 2 diabetes, was supportive and offered to be trained on Kamdyn's care. He told Chelesa that they would watch Kamdyn during the first week-then evaluate how things were going. On Kamdyn's second day in the program, her blood sugar level began to drop a bit, but was still within a normal range. Chelesa explained how to give Kamdyn some gummies to treat the dropping blood sugar. At the same time, a regional Boys & Girls Club Service Director was nearby and overheard what was happening. She decided that Kamdyn posed a safety risk to the program. At 8:30 p.m. that night, Chelesa received a call and was told that Kamdyn could not return to the program the next day. Chelesa did not have another option for after school care, so this was a problem, especially on such short notice. Chelesa knew about disability discrimination law and was upset. She knew that her daughter had legal rights and should not have been barred from the program, just because of diabetes. Chelesa contacted the American Diabetes Association. She spoke with a Legal Advocate, who confirmed that Kamdyn was protected under federal law. It was illegal to exclude her. Chelesa was happy to confirm that her daughter had legal rights, but believed that it would be hard to challenge the Club's decision on her own. However, she had confidence that the American Diabetes Association would be respected as a national leader, so she decided to write a letter to challenge the Boys & Girls Club decision, explaining that she had received information about Kamdyn's rights from an attorney at the Association. Chelesa didn't just write the letter to help her daughter. She also wanted to help other children who might be turned away from the program, just because of a disability. She wanted to educate the program's staff about the law and help get the policy changed.In her letter to the Boys & Girls Club, Chelesa wrote "you have a great program that is a wonderful asset to the community. It should be open to all children, as your mission states." The Boys & Girls Club's regional staff responded the very same day Chelesa's letter arrived. Kamdyn was accepted back into the program. Kamdyn does not currently attend the Boys & Girls Club program, but Chelesa may want to enroll her again in the future. She's happy they'll have that option. "It's nice being able to use the American Diabetes Association as a powerhouse along with legislation to help keep our children safe and treated fairly. Thanks for all you do." — Chelesa Wilds. Vaughn Christian Story Download a print-ready PDF of this story. Vaughn Christian of Jacksonville, Florida loves summer camp. Vaughn, who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in the fall of 2014, is like millions of others who attend camp each year. They love camp because it's fun, helps build great relationships and offers learning and other experiences that are not available most anywhere else. So, in the spring of 2015, when Vaughn's mother, Kira, got a message from her son's camp saying that he could not attend that summer, she was upset. She was told, "I'm sorry for the bad news. We are not equipped to handle a camper with diabetes." Kira has been a paralegal for years and, with her legal background, believed that Vaughn had rights that made this situation unfair. Kira could not bring herself to tell Vaughn that he couldn't go to camp, especially that it was because of his diabetes. She knew that Vaughn would not handle the news very well. She wrote, "My son has been begging to go to camp this summer. Telling him he can't go would severely affect his self-esteem. I want him to have a normal camp experience like other kids. Thank you for any legal advice you can provide to help my son." Kira spoke with a Legal Advocate at the Association and learned that Vaughn did have legal rights. She was told that, under federal law, Vaughn should be allowed to attend camp. The Legal Advocate also shared helpful resources, such as a sample letter to mail to the camp, tips on how to speak with administrators and hints about negotiating on behalf of her son. Supplied with this information, Kira was successful. The camp reversed its policy, made changes to care for Vaughn's diabetes and allowed him to attend. Kira never even told Vaughn what had happened. He just went to camp and had a great time. He had no medical problems at all; things went very well. Having diabetes should never have been an issue in the first place. "I am so thankful for the American Diabetes Association. I have volunteered to get involved and help others who may not know where to turn when their child is being unjustly discriminated against." — Kira, Vaughn's Mom View More Success Stories   Read What Others Are Saying About the Legal Advocacy Program "Without the legal guidance offered by the American Diabetes Association, this matter could have been ignored.
